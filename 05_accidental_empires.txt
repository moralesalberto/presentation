I read the whole thing that night. I stayed up until 3AM. I was like, “Oh my God!, there is whole industry, a whole movement out there, and I am not part of it.”

So the rest as they say is history. I did go back and wrote the database application that would track the manufacturing line.

I went on from that job and became an IT consultant, did consulting work for other manufacturing firms initially. Eventually I landed a consulting job at OPNET, and after a while they decided to hire me full time as their CIO. I have been their CIO for the past 13 years.
