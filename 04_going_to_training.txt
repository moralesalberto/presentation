So off I went to class. I took a class in Database Design in Cupertino. Since I was going to spend a week somewhere, might as well be the epicenter. It was Mecca. While I was there, I did the sites, Fry’s Electronics, Apple’s Infinite Loop, etc. I loved it. 

During class, the instructor mentions this book he was reading called: Accidental Empires by Xris Cringley. It was about the history of Silicon Valley. He goes on that it is quite humorous and a great insight into the main characters in the tech sector.

I was intrigued, so that very night, I went and bought the book and started reading it. I COULD NOT put this book down.
