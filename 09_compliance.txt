With IT in the enterprise, something else creeps up. Specially if you are a public company, or a company dealing with the health care industry or financial services industry.

You need to deal with compliance and regulations. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about avoiding it, you just have to do it.

The thing about compliance is that there are only “guidelines”. There are no hard set of instructions that if you follow you are compliant. No recipe that you pay a consultant, you go through the bullet points and you are done. No, they tell you, every business is different. Oh how consultants lovel that line. Not surprisingly, compliance has created a whole industry of consultants to help companies be compliant.

Again keep it in perspective. It is a necessary evil, but you can still keep it simple. Read the regulations yourself, find the sentence or phrase that you are trying to comply with and address just that. 

I can tell you from experience that all these compliance issues converge on some key points:

Security (Do you have controls in place that ensure no one can get to the systems that is not authorized)
Segregation of Duties (To prevent fraud, ensure not a single person can completely control one process)
Documentation/Communication (Do staff know about the regulations, do they know how they can cause fraud or be part of this)
Oversight(Is anyone reviewing this, are Managers ensuring the processes are followed?)

We have honed compliance to a science now. We are fully SOX compliant, pass with flying colors, but that has not robbed us of the agility we pride ourselves in.

Compliance is a necessary evil, but one that can be kept at bay so that it does not slow you down.
