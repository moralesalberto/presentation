The value IT brings to an enterprise is in the business applications it offers to its staff, its customers, potential customers, etc.

Business applications are the conduit by which staff, customers, vendors, do business with the company. By carefully selecting which applications to provide, by carefully selecting what feature sets to provide, what feature sets to eliminate, IT is  in a position to move the business forward.

Business Applications are the essence of the value IT provides to the enterprise.

For example, if an application is cumbersome to use, or does not have the appropriate features to complete the business process, the staff will not use it. What is worse, that application adds more work!

Staff will do data entry into the application, and they will also do data entry into their excel spreadsheets. Walk into any enterprise, they will show you their business apps, and if they trust you, they will show you what they REALLY use. Most of the time, it will be Excel files.

However if we nail the requirements, and staff embrace the business application; the win to the business is HUGE!

The sad part is that so many IT shops never really get to this point. By the time they get their infrastructure in check, and by the time they engage vendors, and by the time they implement the ERP application, they have run out of money and time. The window of opportunity to provide value is gone.

Nail the business applications, distill the feature set to what is needed, and watch how your enterprise takes off. This is the essence of the value of IT in the enteprise.
