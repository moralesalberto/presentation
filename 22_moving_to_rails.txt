Still, the move to Rails was a risky one.  We knew nothing of Ruby and my team, only had academic training in object oriented programming.

And here I was willing to bet the company on it. I also knew that if I was going to change direction, the move would have to be a decisive one, no tip toeing into the pool. I had to take the plunge to see if this was worth while. 

What encouraged me were the core values that Rails embodied. They were so in sync with how we did things; it just seemed right. 

So I discussed it with the President of the company, and he trusts me on this matters, so he gave me the green light.
