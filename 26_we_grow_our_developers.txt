I favor hiring developers just out of school. When we hire developers, we grow them. They learn the ins and outs of the business with every engagement. I look for smart individuals, eager to learn, but also computer scientists that have an interest in the business side of things. Not a common trait.

They learn to be business analysts, they learn to care just as much about the process as the application they are building. And this is KEY.

I have fully rounded individuals. They know how to talk to our other business groups, they know how to give demos, they know how to gather system requirements, etc. And they take all this and there is no need for translation. They are the same person that is coding!
