So if the IT infrastructure is just the plumbing, and compliance is just a necessary evil, where is the value of IT for the enterprise?

This question is asked so many times, and so much energy is put into this because so many companies are stuck with just getting their IT infrastructure to run cost effectively. Or they get stuck adding so many compliance controls the staff can not get their work done efficiently any more.

And, so many enterprises rely on commercial software for their infrastructure. So before they get to the part of providing value, they are costing the company millions!

No wonder business people ask where is the value in IT.

And if you ask a consultant, you will get again such a convoluted answer, you will wonder about this forever.

Well today, I will tell you straight out where the value is.
