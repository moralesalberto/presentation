He continues and says, “Alberto, if an airplane goes down, and our brakes are questioned, 
we want to be able to trace all our data all the way back. Cradle to grave.”

I understood the need for traceability, but this was ridiculous. This is 1991, so I knew there were better ways to do this. So I go to my boss and I tell him we have to computerize this QA stuff. 

He tells me, “Alberto, you know the budget for this project very well; we never planned to have the QA part computerized, so this is not in the budget.”

“But we have money in training”, I say. You see we had to train the employees that would run these lines, etc. “So, I will teach myself this stuff and write the program myself” I tell him.

You have to understand the aerospace industry. It moves at a glacial pace. We were just at the prototype step, I had a year or two before these plants would be operational. And I had a Bachelors and Masters in Science after all. I had taken programming courses, I had FORTRAN, Pascal, C. I knew how to program; I just never saw a practical need for programming for my job duties. Now I had a real need, I had a manufacturing line I had worked hard at and wanted to be proud of it. This line had to be automated, even if I had to write the programs myself.
