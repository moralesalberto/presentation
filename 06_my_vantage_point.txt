I told you this story to explain to you my vantage point.

To me, IT in the enterprise, has to have a practical application. IT is just a means to an end.

As a matter of fact, IT in the enterprise, did not make sense to me until I had a real business process in front of me that could use some automation.

This point of view has served me well. I do not get lost in the forest that has become IT.
